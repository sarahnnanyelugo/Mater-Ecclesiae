              <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>
                HIS EARLY LIFE: Monday, 1st day of June 1959 was a day of great
                joy in the family of Gregory Obasola and Victoria Oluremi
                Martins (both of blessed memory). That day witnessed the birth
                of their third child, the second son of the family. He was
                christened Alfred Anthony Adewale. His parents who were both
                teachers hailed from Ake and ljemo in Abeokuta South Local
                Government Area of Ogun State. The young Alfred Martins had his
                primary education at St. Augustine Roman Catholic Mission
                School, ltesi.
              </p>

              <p>
                Alfred was admitted to St. Theresa Minor Seminary, Oke-Are,
                lbadan for his secondary education from 1971-1976. During this
                period, the seminary motto: AD ALTARE DEl must have made a deep
                impression on his tender mind as he tried to discern the
                genuineness of the call to the priesthood. At the end of his
                formation in the minor seminary, the young Dewale’, as he was
                fondly called then, signified his intention to continue the
                programme of formation for the priesthood in the major seminary
              </p>

              <h3>SERMINARY LIFE</h3>
              <p>
                The newly ordained Revd. Fr. Alfred Martins was assigned to work
                after his ordination as an Assistant Administrator at Holy Cross
                Cathedral from October 1983 to August 1984. He was later
                transferred to St. Gregory’s College, Obalende, Lagos, where he
                worked as a teacher and chaplain from September 1984 to
                September 1986. During his stay at St Gregory’s College, he
                doubled as the priest in-charge of St Theresa’s Catholic Church
                Maroko as well as chaplain to Holy Child College, Obalende.{" "}
                <br />
                The natural flair for teaching which Fr. Martins had imbibed
                from his parents was discovered through these assignments. He
                was then seconded to the SS Peter and Paul Major Seminary,
                Bodija, to assist in the formation of future priests as Graduate
                Assistant in September, 1986 where he taught courses in the
                Department of Philosophy. His ardent devotion to studies spurred
                him to the status of a Lecturer in 1988 having bagged a Master’s
                degree in Philosophy at the University of Ibadan. <br />
                The humble and gentle Fr. Martins occupied various positions
                that distinguished him in the Seminary Community. He was the
                Bursar of the Seminary (1988-1994). He was the Registrar
                (1994-1996), and also the Secretary, Appointments and Promotions
                Committee (1994 – 1996)
                <br />
                To further enrich his knowledge in his field of specialization,
                Fr. Martins secured admission to the University of St. Andrews,
                Scotland, where he bagged a Master of Letters degree in
                Philosophy in 1997. He immediately enrolled on the PhD programme
                of the University of Edinburgh and had just submitted his
                Proposal when the Holy Father appointed him the first bishop of
                the newly created Diocese of Abeokuta.

                <h3>EPISCOPAL MINISTRY</h3>
                On the 24th of November 1997, the creation of the Catholic
                diocese of Abeokuta was announced as well as the appointment of
                Revd. Fr. Alfred Martins by the Holy Father, Blessed John Paul
                II as the first Bishop of the new diocese excised from the
                Archdiocese of Lagos. He received Episcopal consecration at the
                hands of the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano
                assisted by the Most Revd. Anthony Okogie, the Archbishop of
                Lagos and The Most Revd. Albert Fasina, Bishop of Ijebu-Ode
                diocese, at the M. K. O. Abiola Stadium Abeokuta on the 24th of
                January, 1998.
                <br /> Bishop Adewale Martins had the privilege of leading the
                people of God in Abeokuta from the inception of the diocese,
                building up a young and struggling local Church with only nine
                (9) parishes and eight (8) incardinated priests to a vibrant and
                dynamic church, with a rich stock of about sixty (60) priests
                out of which about forty-four (44) are incardinated priests of
                the diocese. In the same vein, the parishes of the diocese now
                number over thirty, and they are steadily growing into
                faith-rich communities full of possibilities and a flora of
                beauty. The diocese has also grown in the area of health
                provision, with the establishment of a second Sacred Heart
                Hospital in Aiyetoro and Primary Health Clinics in many of the
                Parishes within the Diocese. The Sacred Heart Hospital Lantoro
                has continued in its stride as a major health care provider for
                the teeming population of Ogun State residents and beyond. The
                education sector of Ogun State has also been enhanced by the
                establishment by Bishop Martins, of Sacred Heart Catholic
                College Abeokuta, in 1999 and St. Patrick’s Catholic College,
                lmeko in 2006. He also contributed immensely to discussions
                leading to the return of secondary schools to original owners in
                Ogun State, a development which led to the return of St. Peter’s
                College, Olomore Abeokuta and Catholic Comprehensive High
                School, lbara Abeokuta to the Diocese of Abeokuta in 2009.
                <br />
                <br />
                Primary education has also grew tremendously within the period
                of the stewardship of Bishop Martins as Bishop of Abeokuta with
                the establishment of St. Bernadette of Lourdes Nursery/Primary
                School, Abeokuta and the relocation of St. Luke Nursery/Primary
                School, lwoye. Within the fourteen years of his Episcopal
                ministry in Abeokuta, Bishop Martins also played a significant
                role in the Nigerian Church. He was elected Assistant Secretary
                of the Catholic Bishop’s Conference for two terms (2002-2008).
                He was elected Secretary of the same body for two terms
                (2008-2012). He was Co-Chairman of the Nigerian Anglican-Roman
                Catholic Commission in 2001 till 2008. He was Episcopal Chairman
                of the CBCN committee on Ecumenism from 1999- 2008. He was a
                delegate of the Nigerian Church to the 2nd Ordinary Special
                Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops in Rome (4-25
                October 2009). Following the retirement of His Eminence, Anthony
                Cardinal Okogie of Lagos having reached the canonical age, the
                Holy Father Pope Benedict XVI on May 25, 2012 appointed Bishop
                Alfred Adewale Martins as his successor to the See of Lagos. He
                becomes the fourth Archbishop of the See of Lagos after Late
                Archbishop Leo Hale Taylor SMA (1950-1965); Late Archbishop Kwao
                Amusu Aggey (1965-1972) and Anthony Cardinal Okogie (1973-2012).
                Most Revd Alfred Martins was installed as the Archbishop of
                Lagos on the 4th of August 2012 at the Holy Cross Cathedral
                Lagos by the Apostolic Nuncio to Nigeria, Most Revd Augustine
                Kasujja. Welcome to Maryland Comprehensive Secondary School, a
