            <h4>Nigerian And British Curriculum</h4>
            <p>
              Junior school at Evergreen Secondary School is more than a prelude
              to the high school years. Junior school is an intentional effort
              to combine an individually-customized academic program with a
              Christ-centered culture. Junior school classes build upon the
              foundation of the student’s elementary years, preparing for the
              best of what is to come in high school. With differentiated
              instruction and workshop model classrooms, our teachers Go Beyond,
              ignite academic growth, and help students identify and nurture
              their God-given gifts and talents – one student at a time.
